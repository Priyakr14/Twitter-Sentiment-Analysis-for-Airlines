The easiest way to get started is to download Anaconda, which is free and open source. When you download this, it comes with the Jupyter Notebook IDE and many popular data science libraries, so you don’t have to install them one by one.

Here are the steps you’ll need:

1. Download Anaconda
I highly recommend that you download the Python 3.7 version.

2. Download the Jupyter Notebooks
Clone or download this Github repository, so you have access to all the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb extension). Note the green button on the right side of the screen that says Clone or download. If you know how to use Github, go ahead and clone the repo. If you don't know how to use Github, you can also just download the zip file and unzip it on your laptop.

3. Launch Anaconda and Open a Jupyter Notebook
Windows: Open the Anaconda Navigator program. You should see the Jupyter Notebook logo. Below the logo, click Launch. A browser window should open up. In the browser window, navigate to the location of the saved Jupyter Notebook files and open .ipynb files. Follow the instructions in the notebook.
